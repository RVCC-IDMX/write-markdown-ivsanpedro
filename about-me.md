# About me

## My name

**Ivana San Pedro**

## What I'm studying

I am majoring in Computer Science.

## Why I'm taking this course

I am required to take this course before I graduate. However, I am interested in learning about JavaScript. 

## My programming experience

- Built a website once in _Professor Caruso's_ course, but I ~~struggled~~ had difficulty adjusting the size of images according to the screen size
- Programmed simple user input games in NetBeans
- Programmed in Java and Python


## A fun fact about me

I have a **love** for recording special moments in life, big or small. During the pandemic, I started taking pictures on film. Since then, I take my film camera everywhere I go. I make sure to get physical copies of the images when they get developed, so I can put them in a photo album. Growing up, I enjoyed flipping through family photo albums. I aspire to have a *large collection* of albums when I am in my sixties, so I can show my kids a sneak peek into my youth. 

## My goals for this semester

1. Get comfortable with GitHub
2. Be **proud** of my programming
3. Understand more about JavaScript
